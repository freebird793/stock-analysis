#OverView of Project

My friend Steve just graduated college with a finance degree and his parents wanted to be his first clients. Steve's parents want to invest in new green energy stocks and Steve promised to do the research for them. He has compiled an excel file full of multiple green energy companies' stock information and is looking for a more efficient way to analyze the data. He asked me if I could create a macro for him so that he can quickly and efficiently analyze the data he has compiled. I agreed to help him with his analysis because I knew I could create a macro using VBA language to help my friend Steve achieve his goal.

#Results
Steve wanted to see the annual return for years 2017 & 2018 for his portfolio of green energy stocks, so that is the main measure I designed my macro to calculate for him. He also wanted to see the most frequently traded stocks of the portfolio, those are highlighted in green and the rest are red. 2017 was a much better year for his portfolio than 2018. 

Most of his selected green energy stocks in 2017 had large gains this year but appear to drawback in 2018.
